# .Rprofile
Rprofile file and other default settings for R

R has features to allow you to customize the start-up protocols. These are often used to automatically load packages or custom functions that you use regularly, or to change default settings. These settings can be saved in a .Rprofile file that is saved in your R directory.

# Overview R CRAN
By default R looks for and runs .Rprofile files in the three locations described above, in a specific order. .Rprofile files are simply R scripts that run each time R runs and they can be found within R_HOME, HOME and the projectâ€™s home directory, found with the R command :
```r
getwd()

if(!file.exists("~/.Rprofile")) # only create if not already there
  file.create("~/.Rprofile")    # (don't overwrite it)
file.edit("~/.Rprofile")

```
